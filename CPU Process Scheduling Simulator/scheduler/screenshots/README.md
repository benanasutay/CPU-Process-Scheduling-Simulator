# Screenshots Directory

This folder contains text-based output captures from running various scheduling algorithms.

## Files
- `01_FCFS_output.txt` - First-Come First-Served algorithm execution
- `02_SJF_output.txt` - Shortest Job First algorithm execution
- `03_RR_output.txt` - Round Robin algorithm execution (quantum=2)
- `04_ALL_comparison.txt` - All algorithms comparison with summary table

## Purpose
These files serve as execution log "screenshots" for the project demonstration.
They show the exact output that would appear in the terminal when running each algorithm.
